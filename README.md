### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an 21-year-old Network Security Engineer with a drive to create new and interesting things, from the development of the back-end of common computer games to empowering autonomous robots!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m an alumnus of a @FIRSTRobotics affiliate team, in which I focused on aspects of autonomous and safety-oriented robots!

âœ¨ I currently work in Network Security, handling security appliances such as firewalls and load balancers, although I often times work on projects involving other specialties!

Hope to see ya around!
